title: 'Studio: FlickList 6'
currentMenu: studios

In this studio we will build persistence into our app. Finally, our hypothetical user will be able to add a new movie to the list, close the window and go eat a sandwich, forget what movie she wanted to watch, and then come running back to our site, and the same movie will still be faithfully sitting in her list so she can go stream it on our other awesome website, FlixNet.

We'll start using a term and associated acronym that is common when connecting applications to databases, but isn't used in the Udacity course: **object-relational mapping (ORM)**. Applications store information in the form of *objects* and databases store data in the form of *relational data* (in tables). An ORM library or module will often do much of the heavy lifting for us, when it comes to translating back and forth between these differing contexts.

## Walkthrough

### Before the Walkthrough

Between the last class and this one, we've made an important update to our app.

- Base `Handler` class
  - All handler classes that previously inherited from `webapp2.RequestHandler` now inherit from a base class called `Handler` (which itself inherits from `webapp2.RequestHandler`). We have dropped one method in there, `renderError`. This is nice because any of the subclasses can now use that method. And in the future we might add more methods here.

### During Walkthrough

During the walkthrough, we will lay the groundwork for storing data, and begin to adapt our app to use data from the database. Here are some of the tasks that will be carried out.

- Import the `db` class from the `google.appengine.ext` module
- Create `Movie` model object
  - with `db` properties `title`, `watched`, `rating` and `created`
- On `AddMovie` handler, create a movie object, and use `put` ORM method to save it to the datastore
  - From the admin panel, observe that it was indeed saved
- On `Index` handler, don't use `getUnwatchedMovies()` function. Instead use a GqlQuery on the database
  - Result should be one item in the list, but with no title. Why not? Gotta go to the `frontpage.html` template and adjust to use `movie.title` instead of just `movie`.
- Implement persistant "watching"
  - In the `WatchedMovie` handler, update `movie.watched` property to `True`
  - On the `frontpage.html` template, use `movie.key().id()` as the value for each hidden input

## Studio

Now that we have some database functionality wired into our application, let's continue to convert our app to use the database. Our next task is to implement persistent ratings, so a user can rate a movie and the information is stored in the database for later.

### Checking out the Studio code

Follow the [instructions for getting the code][get-the-code] in order to get the starter code for `studio6`.

### Your Tasks

1. In `MovieRatings.get` write a GQL query to select all the movies that have been watched
  - Extra credit: sort by creation date (most recent first).
2. In `MovieRatings.post`, use the `Movie.get_by_id` ORM method to find the movie with the id specified by the form submission.
3. In `MovieRatings.post`, update the movie's rating to the new rating specified by the form submission.
4. In `rating-confirmation.html`, update the code so that it still works now that it is being given a movie *object*.
